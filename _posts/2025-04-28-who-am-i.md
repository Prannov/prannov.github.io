# Who was I?

I was a boy with a dream — a dream so blurred, it was like reaching for the top of a mountain without knowing why I wanted to get there.  
So, I started trekking alone.

Along the way, I met many people — fellow travelers I didn’t expect but welcomed anyway.  
I began the journey with no map, no clear intention of what was waiting ahead, only an excitement to be part of the journey itself.

The dream wasn't about being someone, or becoming something, or even achieving anything specific.  
It was something harder to define — not this, not that, just... something.  
A dream that refused to fit inside clean words, but lived in the spaces between them.

## Seed to Tree:

Like a seed buried deep in the soil, I had no clear shape, no distinct form yet.  
My journey was a mystery — undefined, but always growing, always reaching for something, somewhere.  
The first roots had no answers, but they were the foundation for what would come.

# Who I wanted to be

I wanted to be a respectable boy — or man — though even now, I’m not sure respectable by whom.  
It felt like boarding a train without knowing its destination, just enjoying the ride while it lasted.

Again, it was the same old story: no clear words, just young, wild fantasies pulling me forward.  
I wanted to be a traveler — not just across places, but across life itself.

Looking back, maybe that boy had serious plans buried beneath all that dreaming.  
There were societal norms, personal norms, and the invisible rules no one talked about — and yet, I wanted to be someone different.

Maybe the real motivation wasn’t a clear vision... but a quiet fear: the fear of being average.

---

## Seed to Tree:

At this stage, I was like a sapling — reaching out but unsure of which direction to grow.  
My roots began to stretch, and the stem pushed upward, trying to find a way to stand tall, not knowing which winds would shape me, but trusting the growth would happen regardless.

# Who am I?

Now, who am I?  
I don't know. I never really did — and maybe I never will.

Every time this question pops up, I get a different answer.  
And getting different answers is fine... but what's strange is how I feel like a different person every time.

Sometimes I don't even recognize the version of me that shows up.

Maybe it’s because I keep moving through different places, different moments, different storms — like a traveler, not just across lands but across life itself.

I am not my name.  
I am not my job.  
I am someone I don’t fully know.

To one fellow traveler, I might be one thing; to another, I might be something else entirely.  
And to myself?  
I’m a mystery I keep solving every time the question finds me again.

There’s no constant. Only change.  
But somehow, the change itself has become my only constant.

---

## Seed to Tree:

I am the tree whose leaves turn in every season.  
I might not always know which branch to grow, but every leaf that falls and every new bud that blooms helps me understand more of who I am — constantly shifting, constantly evolving, and never static.

# Who will I be?

Great question again.  

You can have a path for your career.  
You can have a path for your relationships.  
But how can you have a path for who you want to be?

"Who will I be?" isn't about what profession I’ll choose, or what I’ll do once I hit some milestone age, or where I'll be after 5 or 10 years.  
It's about something deeper —

- What will my perception of life become?
- How will I evolve?
- How will the same old senses I've had since childhood — the same eyes, the same heart — experience the world differently as I keep moving?
- How will the external world shape my internal world, and how will that reflection echo back into who I am?

Now, I feel being "average" is no small thing.  
It’s a great feat in itself.  
Funny how the boy who once feared being average now sees it differently.

See how "who I wanted to be" changed when it turned into "who will I be"?

Maybe reaching the top of the mountain was never really the goal.  
Maybe it was about traveling the mountain — surviving the trek, feeling the pain and the pleasure, sharing the journey with others.  
Maybe there never was a top at all.  
Maybe it was always the blur — the journey — that mattered.

---

## Seed to Tree:

Now, as I grow taller, I start to see that reaching the top is not the point.  
The growth is what matters.  
With every branch that extends, with every new season I endure, I understand that I’m evolving — but the evolution itself is where the beauty lies.

# Should I be who I think I will be?

I want to end with this because, honestly, why should anyone try to pin down who they’ll become?

So much in life changes — decisions, situations, moments — and you’ll become someone, just like the tides shift the sand, or like pollen drifts through the air with no clear destination.

But if you look closely, there’s a strange connection between purpose and randomness.

I still want to be someone different from the "normal" curve, the ordinary path people follow.  
But remember, in the last question, I said I’m okay with being average.

I guess life can drift you far, but there’s always a direction, even when it feels uncertain.  
There’s a fine balance between holding onto your direction and letting life carry you with its tides.

Because if you drift too much, you’ll lose yourself in the currents, but if you stay too rigid, you’ll miss the journey itself.

So here I am, sharing my **सफ़र (safar)** — my journey — and let’s see if I become who I want to be.  
Let’s see how this story unfolds.

---

## Seed to Tree:

Now, I stand at the edge, still growing, still reaching upward, but no longer bound by the idea of where I "should" end up.  
I’m becoming the tree that sways in the wind, bends with the seasons, and grows in its own way, free from rigid expectations.  
The journey continues, and so does my growth.
